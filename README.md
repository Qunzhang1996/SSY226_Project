# SSY226 Design Project Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the SSY226 design project at Chalmers University of Technology, focusing on the development of trajectory tracking solutions for collaborative highway-merging of vehicles.

## Project Supervision

- **Supervisor:** Dr. Pavel Anistratov
- **Contact:** [pavel.anistratov@chalmers.se](mailto:pavel.anistratov@chalmers.se)

## Key Components

### Trajectory Tracking Implementation

For an in-depth look at our trajectory tracking algorithm, please visit the `luming` branch and review the `map_test_luming_traj_tracking.py` file.

### Final Report

The comprehensive findings of our project are documented in "Modeling and Simulation of Collaborative Highway-merging Vehicles - Group 11," available in the main branch.

## Reference Materials

### Academic Papers

For a detailed exploration of our theoretical underpinnings, refer to the documents within the "reference paper" folder.

### Project Documentation

Our project's documentation process is facilitated through Overleaf. Access our project documentation here: [Overleaf Project](https://www.overleaf.com/project/655caa1f758cf35510b63e5d).

## Multimedia

### Video Demonstrations

Our project's implementations and results are showcased in a series of videos available at: [Project Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfi-srdJh5ddZDsl7bJtQfmNswJQYdw1R).

## Visual Representations

To aid in understanding our project's methodologies and results, we have included several visual representations:
